# conditional random fields(CRFs)   
  * A CRF is a Discriminative Probabilistic Classifiers(conditional probability distribution, i.e., P(y|x))       
  * predict sequence of labels that correspond to a sequence of inputs
  * In CRFs, the input is a set of features (real numbers) derived from the input sequence using feature functions, 
  the weights associated with the features (that are learned) and the previous label and the task is to predict the current label
