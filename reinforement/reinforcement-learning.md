# reinforcement learning
how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward

#### Online decision making involves a fundamental choice:
* Exploitation: make the best decision given current    
* information Exploration: gather more information

#### epsilon greed
One common use of epsilon-greedy is in the so-called multi-armed bandit problem


#### value based
* harder problem
* Q-learning, value iteration  
* inner exploration

#### policy based
* easy problem   
* innate exploration
