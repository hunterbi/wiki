# machine learning    

* Supervised learning        
learning a function from [labeled] training data.

* unsupervised learning    
learning a function from [unlabeled] training data.



* regression learning   
estimate the relationships among variables    

* classification  
identify which categories a new variables belongs to         

* Probabilistic classification         
predict a probability distribution    
        
* Kernel method(kick)      
compute the dot product of two vectors x and y (possibly very high dimensional) feature space.     
kernel functions is called "generalized dot product".
