# defition:
reduce the number of random variables. It contains feature selection and feature extraction.

# solution     
* missing Values:      
too many missing values, drop them, because it would not help improving the power of model.

* low variance:     
these variables will not explain the variation in target variables.
e.g. constant variable, variance is zero

* random Forest:       
it is good accuracy, robust and easy to use.      
. mean decrease impurity         
. mean decrease accuracy     

* factor analysis:  
find the variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of a potentially factors(lower number of unobserved variables)   
. EFA (Exploratory Factor Analysis)              
. CFA (Confirmatory Factor Analysis)         
    
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)     
transform into a new set of variables as principle component(e.g. The second principal component must be orthogonal to the first principal component),it does its best to capture the variance in the data

tips:    
standardize variables, because it is sentive to scale.
